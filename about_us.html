                    <p><br>Hailing from our beautiful twin-island state of Trinidad and Tobago, HoneyBee Bakery is as authentic as it gets with all your favourite Trinbagonian baked goods. 
                        But every success has its own origin story. HoneyBee started as the unrefined aspirations of 13-year old Maya Brant, who decided at right then and there that she needed to do more with her gift of baking. With traditional recipes passed down from generation to generation of the matriarchal Brant family, Maya was confident she 
                        could realize her dream. Starting as a small pop-up shop on Henry Street, Maraval in 2018, Maya grew her business into the own-stop final destination of all baked needs!<br></p>
